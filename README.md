# neo-contracts-workspace-kotlin

A starting point for writing contracts in kotlin

## Building the contracts

You don't need anything other than [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download) and access to `make`. Just run `make` to build the contract avms. It might take a while the first time.

Compiled contract classes may be found in `target/classes`.

Compiled contract avm files may be found in `target/contract-avms`.
